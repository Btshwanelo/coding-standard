// Summary
// Naming standards are important because it helps keep your code consistent and predictable. Anything violating that predictability tends to be suspect. However, well-chosen naming standards can make it easier to understand your code and, if done well, can often make it possible to see a error in a single line of code.

// Use underscore_names instead of CamelCase
// Table names should be plural eg: customers instead of customer
// Spell out id fields (item_id instead of id)
// Don't use ambiguous column names
// When possible, name foreign key columns the same as the columns they refer to
